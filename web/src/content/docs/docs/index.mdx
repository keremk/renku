## Key Features

### Build System for Video

Like software build tools, Renku tracks dependencies and only regenerates what's needed. Change an input, and only affected artifacts are rebuilt.

### Multi-Provider Orchestration

Coordinate OpenAI, Replicate, fal.ai, ElevenLabs, and more in a single workflow. Each provider handles what it does best.

### Declarative Blueprints

Define your video generation workflow in YAML. Blueprints are reusable, shareable, and version-controllable.

### Parallel Execution

Generate multiple video segments simultaneously. Renku automatically parallelizes independent tasks across execution layers.

### Extensible Architecture

Add new AI models, providers, and producers as the ecosystem evolves. The plugin architecture makes extension straightforward.
