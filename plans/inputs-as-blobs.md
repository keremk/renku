Also even though we have a way to pass in blobs as artifacts, so far we have not created a way to pass in user inputs that are
  blobs. All user inputs have been basic non-blobs. So there should be a way in the inputs.yaml to specify a blob (a file for image,
  video etc.), we can have the local path of the file to do that, but once the inputs.
