You've got to try it—book a tandem and go!' Natural wind roar, voice close-mic'd and slightly compressed so it's intelligible. Midday sun, goggles and jumpsuit flutter, altimeter visible, parachute rig on shoulders. Energetic but stable framing with subtle shake; brief horizon roll. End on first tug of canopy and wind noise dropping."
