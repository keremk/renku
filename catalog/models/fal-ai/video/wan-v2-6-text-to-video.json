Extreme photoreal 4K, cinematic lighting, subtle film grain, smooth camera. No subtitles, no UI, no watermark.\n\nShot 1 [0-3s] Macro close-up on the fox snapping a clapboard labeled \"fal\". the fox says : \"Action.\"\nShot 2 [3-6s] Hard cut: Wild West street at sunset. Wide shot, dust in the air. The Fox (in frame) points forward: \"Make it wide.\"\nShot 3 [6-10s] Hard cut: jungle river. The fox stands on a small boat. The camera pushes forward through vines and mist. Fox saying: \"Now… adventure.\"\nShot 4 [10-15s] Hard cut: space station window. Slow orbit around the fox with stars outside. Fox nods: \"Done. Next movie.\"\n"
